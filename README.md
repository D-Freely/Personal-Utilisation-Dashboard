# Personal-Utilisation-Dashboard
Python script which creates an interactive dashboard from work utilisation data.

Python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Dash

### Description

At my job, the only tool we had to process personal utilisation data was an outdated timesheet system which we could use to export a csv file over a select time period. Once exported, the file was simply a table of raw data which we would then use to tell our story for moderation come year-end. I therefore decided to write this python script which, using plotly dash functionality, creates an interactive web application from the raw data csv file. Once the dash application is loaded, users can filter the graphs as they please and can also edit the date ranger slider to toggle between different performance periods. 

The dashboard is showcased in the following gif:
